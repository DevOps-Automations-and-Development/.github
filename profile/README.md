# DevOps Automations and Developments
---

**DevOps Automation and Deployment** is a Oraganisation that helps for DevOps practices for development and deployments projects that useful for every devops engineer that solves for very difficult to choose the right path in the middle of so many tools and practices. Here we are exploring various tools and best practices.

## DevOps Tools & Practices

### 1. Development and Build Tooling

**DevOps Build Tools** is a category can orchestrate multiple event streams and integrate easily with external tooling

Tools in this slice of the software development lifecycle fit into three sub-categories:
* Source-Control Management (SCM)
* Continuous Integration (CI)
* Data management


### 2. Automated Testing Tools

We must start an evaluation of automated testing tools by first fitting them into the testing pyramid. The testing pyramid has 4 layers:

* **Unit —** This is your base of all automated testing. As far as volume is concerned, you should have the most unit tests compared to other types. These tests should be written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the “unit”) meets its design and behaves as intended.

* **Component —** The main objective of component testing is to verify the input/output behavior of the test object. This ensures that the test object’s functionality is working correctly, as per the desired specification.

* **Integration —** This is the phase in testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group.

* **End-to-End —** This layer is self-explanatory. We’re looking at the flow of an application, right from the start to the finish, and making that it’s behaving as expected.

### 3. Deployment Tooling

**Deployment tooling** is probably the least understood aspect of application development. For operations folks, it’s hard to use a deployment tool without a deep understanding of the application code and functionality. For developers, managing code deployments is a new responsibility so they have little experience with many deployment tools.

First, let’s break down deployment tooling into three sub-categories:
* Artifact management
* Config management
* Deployment

### 4. Collaboration DevOps Tooling

**Collaboration DevOps Tooling** is a DevOps first and foremost is about culture change within an organization. While buying a tool won’t change the culture overnight, it can certainly help foster new means of working with your colleagues.

Collaboration Tooling sub-categories are:
* Issue Tracking
* ChatOps
* Documentation

### 5. Runtime DevOps Tooling

**Runtime DevOps Tooling** is the end-goal of any development project is running our application in production. In a DevOps world, we want to ensure we have visibility into any potential issues with our environment and we also want to keep human manual intervention to a minimum. Choosing the correct set of runtime tools is critical to reaching development nirvana.

Runtime tooling sub-categories are:
* X-as-a-Service
* Orchestration
* Monitoring
* Logging
